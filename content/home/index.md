# Hey, I'm Ryan - welcome!

Software engineer by day, "maker" by evenings and weekends. Currently in the deep end with Go, 3D printing and a bit of electronics.
When I'm not making things, I'll probably be gaming, watching football (Up the Iron) or MotoGP, cooking or drinking coffee. I've also _started_ to get into running.
Hopefully amongst all these hobbies - I'll find some interesting things to write about! :crossed_fingers:
